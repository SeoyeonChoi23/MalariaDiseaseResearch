Above data sets are set of SMILES notations data set that related to Plasmodium falciparum. 


DataSheet 3 & 4 : Test Dataset part description 
Column DD2 part meaning : 
DeepMalaria uses this Pf Dd2 inhibition and selectivity data for training. The molecules are classified as one if they possess Dd2 growth     inhibitions of 50% and higher and zero if otherwise. The efficacy of these compounds differs in P. falciparum strains Dd2 and 3D7 (a Pf line  sensitive to chloroquine), with most of the molecules in the GSK dataset possessing higher 3D7 inhibition and varying Dd2 inhibition. Therefore, the training data implicitly holds information about the developed resistance, and if the model is trained on Dd2 inhibition data, it would be able to predict compounds that are efficacious in drug-resistant strains, a desirable property (Keshavarzi Arshadi et al.).
